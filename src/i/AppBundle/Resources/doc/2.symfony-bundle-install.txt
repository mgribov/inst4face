  Welcome to the Symfony2 bundle generator  
                                            


Your application code must be written in bundles. This command helps
you generate them easily.

Each bundle is hosted under a namespace (like Acme/Bundle/BlogBundle).
The namespace should begin with a "vendor" name like your company name, your
project name, or your client name, followed by one or more optional category
sub-namespaces, and it should end with the bundle name itself
(which must have Bundle as a suffix).

See http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/best_practices.html#index-1 for more
details on bundle naming conventions.

Use / instead of \  for the namespace delimiter to avoid any problem.

Bundle namespace: i/AppBundle

In your code, a bundle is often referenced by its name. It can be the
concatenation of all namespace parts but it's really up to you to come
up with a unique name (a good practice is to start with the vendor name).
Based on the namespace, we suggest iAppBundle.

Bundle name [iAppBundle]: 

The bundle can be generated anywhere. The suggested default directory uses
the standard conventions.

Target directory [/home/nyccamp/public_html/inst4face/src]: 

Determine the format to use for the generated configuration.

Configuration format (yml, xml, php, or annotation): yml

To help you get started faster, the command can generate some
code snippets for you.

Do you want to generate the whole directory structure [no]? yes

                             
  Summary before generation  
                             

You are going to generate a "i\AppBundle\iAppBundle" bundle
in "/home/nyccamp/public_html/inst4face/src/" using the "yml" format.

Do you confirm generation [yes]? 

                     
  Bundle generation  
                     

Generating the bundle code: OK
Checking that the bundle is autoloaded: OK
Confirm automatic update of your Kernel [yes]? 
Enabling the bundle inside the Kernel: OK
Confirm automatic update of the Routing [yes]? 
Importing the bundle routing resource: OK

                                               
  You can now start using the generated code!
