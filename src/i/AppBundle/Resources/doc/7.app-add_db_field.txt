NOTE: had to make migrations manually, because doctrine migrator had problems:
- Step 2 appended the new var and getter/setter to the end of the file
- Step 2 creates a var without ORM notation?
- Migrator generates gibberish like:
$this->addSql("ALTER TABLE pic ALTER id DROP DEFAULT");
$this->addSql("ALTER TABLE pic ALTER likes SET "); 

1. Add new column definition to the YML mapping file
src/i/AppBundle/Resources/config/doctrine/Login.orm.yml
+        createdAt:
+            type: datetime
+            nullable: false
+            column: created_at


2. Generate the new variable and assoctiated getter/setter in the entity:
./app/console doctrine:generate:entities iAppBundle:Login --no-backup
Generating entity "i\AppBundle\Entity\Login"
  > generating i\AppBundle\Entity\Login

3. Create migration manually and execute it
./app/console doctine:migrations:generate
<add ALTER sql>
./app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
